Inkscape Animation Extension

============================

This extension has nothing to do with svg type animation using SMIL or 
Javascript.  I simply needed a way to import bitmap image frames for inking.
Then I needed a way to extract those inked frames and compile them into a 
movie using ffmpeg.

I recommend starting with a new inkscape document when importing your pencil 
frames.  I usually create my frames using Pencil http://www.pencil-animation.org/
Just input which frame numbers you'd like to import.  Keeping the amount of frames 
low helps inkscape run better (once I add in the "show/hide sub-layers" feature 
this should be less of an issue as the slowdown only happens when many bitmap 
images are actually displayed).  I like to set the document dimensions equal 
to the imported images.  The base filename should include the directory (example:
"/home/me/pencilframes/frame") without the frame number or filetype extension.  
Though, if you save your inkscape file in the same directory as your imported images
you can get away with just using the filename (ex. "frame").  Then enter the filetype
extension of your imported images and apply.  This will create a series of numbered 
layers with four sub-layers ink, paint, pencil, and background.  Pencil will contain
the imported images.  The background will contain a gray colored rectangle the same 
size as the document. (later I'll add an option to choose the rectangle's color)  

Once you have all of your frames inked and painted its time to run the output 
extension.  Enter the directory to save you images to and the base filename without 
the extension and apply.  This should give you a series of inked image frames to input
into ffmpeg or maybe imagemagick and create a movie or gif file.

TODO
====

Make all layers hidden upon import to keep inkscape running smoothly.
Add extension to show/hide sub-layers.
Add option to hide pencil layer (or other layers) during output.
Add option to choose background color or possibly a background image.
Add option to choose sub-layer names.
